# Vendored, reviewed copy of RF.Guru's install-bluetooth.sh
# (github.com/Guru-RF/Analog-HotSPOT-SVXLink/blob/master/install-bluetooth.sh,
# fetched and reviewed 2026-09-06). Sets up the BLE GATT service the
# companion app (svxlink-hotspot.app) connects to -- DTMF, reboot/poweroff,
# SvxLink restart, live state, all without SSH.
#
# Vendored deliberately, NOT fetched fresh on every run like RF.Guru's own
# hotspot-config (see the ble_companion_app memory note / BLE.md review):
# this script only touches bluez/BlueZ config and a new hotspot-bluetooth
# systemd unit, never svxlink.conf or node_info.json, so pinning a reviewed
# copy here is safe and avoids silently running whatever's on GitHub today.
# It still `wget`s the actual GATT daemon (hotspot-bluetooth) and its
# systemd unit fresh from GitHub at install time -- that part we don't fork
# or maintain, since it's ~1300 lines of BlueZ/DBus code we didn't write.
#
# Self-gating: bails cleanly (exit 0) with instructions instead of doing
# anything if the OS needs `apt upgrade`+reboot first, or if BLE needs a
# `dtoverlay=disable-bt` removal + hciuart.service enable that only takes
# effect after a reboot -- safe to call unconditionally from setup.sh.
#
# Re-run this (not hotspot-config) to update Bluetooth support later --
# but note it will reset dashboard/bluetooth/'s "require pairing" toggle
# back off, since that toggle patches the very file this script downloads.
